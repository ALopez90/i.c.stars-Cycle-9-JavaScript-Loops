## Visual Studio Code

Here are some recommended extensions to use!

[!] -- Highly recommend

2. **Beautify/Prettier** -- Will format your code to clean it up!

3. [!] **Comment Anchors** -- An amazing way to keep track of your development and to mark off important sections. You see them used everywhere in these files (NOTE, SECTION, !SECTION, TODO, etc.)!

4. **Bracket Pair Colorizer 2** -- Will color the brackets to make it easier to see what the pairs are.

## Hi, I'm Alexa! ðŸ‘‹
I graduated from i.c.stars |* Milwaukee summer of 2019, Cycle 3. 
I wore many hats as an intern -- project manager, technical analyst, and scrum master. 
Leading my team as the primary developer, we were selected as the winners of Cycle 3's sponsor project. 
It led to use presenting it in front of C-level executives at an event called iOpener at the end of that same year.

Continuing my passion in technology, I found myself working for MacGregor Partners.
Working my way up, I'm now a full stack developer for MacGregor Partners and considered the resident expert at ExtJS!
Current techstack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ExtJS, MOCA, MS SQL, and Java.
