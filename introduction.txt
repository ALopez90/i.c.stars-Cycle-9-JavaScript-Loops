Cycle 9 JavaScript Loops Lesson
Date/Time: 3rd February 2022 | 6:30PM-8:00PM CST

/***************************/
// SECTION Introduction
NOTE Objectives
At the end of this lesson you will...
1. Know how to write all of the basic loops
2. Know the difference between the loops
3. Know how to control the loops

NOTE What is a loop?
A loop is a piece of code that executes repeatedly when a condition is met. They're very useful when working with arrays and objects! It's essentially automating a repetitive task to make your code more efficient (if done correctly).

// SECTION Loop Structure
Loops can be put into two categories...

NOTE - Entry Controlled
These loops are controlled with a condition at the entrance. Requires for a condition to be met before moving inside the loop.
Example:
for and while loops

NOTE - Exit Controlled
These loops are controlled with a condition at the exit. Will enter the loop for until a condition is met.
Example:
do...while loops

// SECTION Lesson Plan
NOTE It's recommended you go through the lessons like so:
1. While Loops (lessons\whileLoops.js)
>While
>Do... While

2. For Loops (lessons\forLoops.js)
>For
>For... In
>For... of

3. Loop Control (lessons\loopControl.js)
>Continue
>Break

// SECTION Comparison Between Loops

NOTE - While Loops (While vs. Do...While)
The "While" loop differs from the "Do...While" loop in one important way...

The "While" loop evaluates the condition at the start of every iteration. Make sure that the condition eventually goes false!! You don't want this to loop forever. (Entry Controlled Loop)

The "Do...While" loop will always be executed once even if the condition is false! This is due to the fact that the condition is evaluated at the end of the loop. (Exit Controlled loop)

NOTE - For Loops (For vs. For...In vs. For...Of)

The "For" loop is the most common loop! It's a great way to have complete control of the array that's being looped through. You can control the number of times it loops (initializer), when the code runs (condition), and the iteration. (Entry Controlled loop)

The "For...In" loop, although can be used with both objects AND arrays, is often used more for objects. It's not recommend to use if the index ORDER is important in an array. (Entry Controlled loop)

The "For...Of" loop can be used with strings and arrays. DOES NOT work with objects. (Entry Controlled loop)
